	The data in Stata 10 format. Note the naming conventions: the variable LABELS contain short descriptors, but
	the variable NAMES do not. Instead, they are consistent with the master dataset from which this replication
	dataset was extracted. Further information is available from the authors.

main
	This folder contains the Stata code to replicate the analyses that appear in the body of the paper.

Please consult the individual readme.txt files before replicating any analysis.  If you find any errors or have any further questions, please address them to me via email at pepinsky@cornell.edu.
